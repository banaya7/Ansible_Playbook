# Ansible Playbooks: Microsoft Defender ATP & GlobalProtect CLI Installation

# Ansible Playbooks for Microsoft Defender ATP & GlobalProtect CLI

Welcome! ðŸŽ‰

This repository contains handy Ansible playbooks to help automate the installation and setup of two powerful tools commonly used in enterprise Linux environments:

- **Microsoft Defender ATP** â€” to protect your Ubuntu servers with Microsoftâ€™s advanced endpoint security.
- **GlobalProtect CLI** â€” the command-line VPN client from Palo Alto Networks, making secure network access a breeze.

Whether youâ€™re managing a few machines or thousands, these playbooks aim to simplify repetitive setup steps, so you can spend less time on manual installs and more on what really matters.

We hope these scripts save you time and make your infrastructure more secure and manageable!

## A Quick Heads-Up (Important!)

- These playbooks assume that you have access to organization-specific files, such as:
  - `MicrosoftDefenderATPOnboardingLinuxServer.py` (from Microsoft Security portal)
  - `PanGPLinux-6.2.0-c10-with-deps.tgz` (from Palo Alto Networks support portal)

These files **are not included in this repository** and **must not be publicly redistributed** due to licensing restrictions.
